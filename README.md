# Data-Science-Problems
Some data science hackathon problems

## data_science_problem_1 
You are asked to build the most accurate model you can to predict target column for data_test.csv. The metric to reflect accuracy can be defined by yourself. 

'id': id column for data_train, data_test, respectively
'num*': numerical features
'der*': derived features from other features
'cat*': categorical features
'target': target column, only exists in data_train. it is binary.

## data_science_problem_2
Create a Service Provider Employee (driver or a.k.a SPE) churn prediction model that will take a SPEâ€™s historical attributes like, frequency of loads moved for XPO, payouts, shipment rejects, demographics, preferences and predict likelihood of driver churn as of today based on the latest information. 
The system should rank the drivers based on the probability of churn and also create appropriate flags for High Risk, Medium Risk and Low Risk drivers.
